Code to Analyze CCEP and compare states of consiousness and arousability

MATLAB code to analyze Cortico-cortical evoked responses (CCEP) following single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) during conscious (awake) and unconscious arousable vvs. unconscious unarousable (propofol induced general anesthesia) states. This software was used in Zelmann et al., Neuron 2023

**Summary** 
What happens in the human brain when we are unconscious? Zelmann et al., provide direct experimental evidence that during unconsciousness, such as natural sleep, the human brain is uniformly affected, while lack of arousability during general anesthesia, is linked to a profound disruption of function and connectivity in prefrontal regions.
